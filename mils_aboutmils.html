 	<h1>About MILS</h1>

	<h2>What We Do</h2>
		<p>MILS is the hub for mindfulness in the legal profession, bringing together lawyers, law students, faculty, Judges, and others in the legal community across the nation. We share resources and provide networking opportunities, including practice area affinity groups, local chapters, virtual sits, webinars, and national conferences. We offer centralized resources for those who seek to create or enhance a mindfulness practice or program for themselves, their law firms, legal communities, and law schools. We are based at Southwestern Law School and are supported by a generous grant from the Lenz Foundation.</p>
